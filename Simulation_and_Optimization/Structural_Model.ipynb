    "# Structural Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially a rocket is a long tube, with a tapered nose, fins at the base, and internal parts distributed along the length. The location of parts is fixed, but the mass within propellant tanks and N2 tanks will change throughout flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will assume each internal part is axially symmetrical. They are located by the position of their bottom in the body-frame coordinates with the base of the rocket as our origin. They are given a material, axial length, radius, and thickness, as well as a geometry. This gives us the flexibility to build our structural model as a nearly arbitrary system of rigid bodies, while automatically calculating mass, center of mass, moments of inertia, etc., from first principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z axis of our body frame is the axial axis, with the positive direction pointed towards the nose. The X and Y axes are currently somewhat arbitrary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geometries\n",
    "### Fin Geometry\n",
    "For our fin geometry, [this](http://www.efunda.com/math/areas/Trapezoid.cfm) and [this](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Trapezoid.html) are useful resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "See fin_geometry.png in respository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometry of a fin is determined by the root chord ($r$), tip chord ($t$), semispan ($h$), and sweep angle ($\\theta$). \n",
    "\n",
    "By the definition of cosine and the Pythagorean Theorem, we immediately deduce that\n",
    "$$b = \\frac{h}{\\cos(\\theta)},$$\n",
    "$$c = \\sqrt{b^2 - h^2},$$\n",
    "$$a = \\sqrt{h^2 + d^2}.$$\n",
    "By inspection, we can see that $$d = t - (r - c) = t - r + c.$$\n",
    "WolframAlpha provides equations for the centroid (i.e., center of mass) of a general trapezoid, which is the intersection of the medians (which bisect each side). Fixing the origin at $O$, to find the centroid $C$ in this fin's frame, we have\n",
    "$$z_c = r/2 + \\frac{(2t+r)(a^2-b^2)}{6(r^2 - t^2)},$$\n",
    "$$y_c = \\frac{r+2t}{3(r+t)}h.$$\n",
    "Recall that the x-axis is normal to the surface of the screen, so $x_c = 0$ by stipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The area of a trapezoid is given by $$A = \\frac{h(r+t)}{2}.$$\n",
    "So given a thickness and density and assuming they are uniform, we can obtain a rough approximation of the mass of the fins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this solution is somewhat inefficient. It may be best to construct fins as a set rather than individually so that we only need to calculate the axial center of mass, since the fins are equally balanced in the x-y plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of time, we will take a cue from OpenRocket and simply assume our fins are rectangles for the purpose of calculating their moments of inertia. If further accuracy is required, we can decompose a trapezoidal fin into two triangles and a rectangle, assume they are \"thin\" and use a combination of known formulas for MoI and the parallel and perpindicular axis theorems to derive more accurate MoI.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I have more time, I plan on merging many of the calculations for aerodynamics into the Fin class for conceptual clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nosecone Geometry\n",
    "The nosecone will be a Von Karman ogive, also known as the LD-Haack design. The radius is the same as the body radius, and the length is specified in the System Definition. Note that after the length of the nosecone, there is some cylindrical portion added by engineering necessitity. The length of the nosecone has not yet been optimized, but a good rule of thumb is to aim for a fineness ratio of 3 - 5. For simplicity, in the MDO we will assume that approximating it by a cone on a cylinder is sufficient for determining the mass, center of mass, and moment of inertia.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Module Geometry\n",
    "This is simply a cylindrical shell. Note that the degenerate case of 0 radius but finite thickness provides a solid cylinder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Component Geometry\n",
    "Most internal components of the rocket are assumed to be solid ellipsoid \"blobs\". Alternatively, a point-mass may be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are two \"special\" types of components, engines and RCS systems. In addition to physical properties, these also have functionalities.\n"

    "## Structures\n",
    "This class is the workhorse we ride into the sunset. Essentially it is a list of parts that are either components or other such lists of parts, and each list also has properties defined by the collective properties of its parts. Additionally, a structure has methods for building it and reading from it recursively. Some structures are dynamic and so are marked as \"not static\", in the sense that their mass distributions are variable over the course of a trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module\n",
    "Modules differ by their materials and how many layers of each material. Modules all have two bulkheads and one pair of interconnect rings with clamps to attach it to the module below. Note that the length of the rings is not included in the length of the module.\n",
    "There are 6\" aluminum micromodules for where piping needs to be run into and out of the airframe. There are 24\" and 36\" carbon fiber or fiberglass modules for holding various subsystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nosecone\n",
    "A nosecone is a structure with two modules, one of which is a cone without bulkheads or rings. Technically, the nosecone is only two layers of carbon fiber composite until its cylindrical part which has a Nomex layer as well. Be aware that the nosecone model in the MDO is an approximation of what the design will actually be.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Propellant Tank\n",
    "Isogrid tanks are structural elements of the airframe, as well as serving the function of holding propellants. Our model is not fancy. It uses effective tank thicknesses from the [isotank repository](https://github.com/psas/lv4-isotank) to estimate mass, and the caps are just flat disks. Tanks also have interconnect rings and clamps and bulkheads/slosh baffles. The LOX tank has a few layers of Cryogel insulation as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The propellant is a component of the tank, and there are methods for removing an amount of propellant from the tank and calculating the volume and mass remaining. We consider the propellant to be a solid cylinder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## N2 Tank\n",
    "A special kind of tank which is not a structural element and contains a compressible fluid. Still a work in progress, and we aren't doing much with this yet. After there is a working model of the RCS system, this will be integrated with that. Then the next step after that is to automate the pressure regulation of the propellant tanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rocket\n",
    "This is incredibly convenient for wrapping all the physical properties of the rocket as one object. We can use it to do recursive operations on all the parts and subparts of the rocket. This structure also has a method for determining whether it has enough fuel for thrust."
